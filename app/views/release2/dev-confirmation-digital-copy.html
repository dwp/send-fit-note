        Keep your fit note safe, do not throw it away.
      </p>

      <p>You do not need to do anything else, or call to check on its progress. If there’s a problem you’ll be contacted.</p>

      <p>If you have given us your mobile number, you will get a text when we receive your fit note. This might take up to 24 hours to arrive and will be sent between Monday and Friday, 8am to 8pm.</p>
      <p>You will need to keep sending us fit notes as long as you're unfit for work. For example, if your fit note is for 14 days, you will need to send  another one when it runs out. We will tell you when you can stop sending them.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you get a reminder letter from DWP</h2>
      <p>If you’ve had a confirmation text from us, you can safely ignore any reminder letters you get in the next few days. </p>
      <p> These letters are just to tell you that your fit note was about to run out. It will have been posted before you uploaded your new fit note.
