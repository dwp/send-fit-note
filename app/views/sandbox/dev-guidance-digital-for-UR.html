    <p>It is important that your fit note can be read by our system, or it could be rejected.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Before you upload your fit note, make sure:</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>it is all on 1 page</li>
          <li>it is not protected by a password
            <li>the whole fit note is visible, including all four corners</li>
            <li>everything can be read easily, including your contact details</li>     
      <li>if it has a data matrix (a black and white square that looks like a QR code), this is clear and not blurred</li></ol>

      <p>If you need to enter a password to see your fit note, our system will not be able to read it and it will be rejected.</p>
      <p>If possible, you should save your fit note as a new file without a password and upload this new version.</p>
